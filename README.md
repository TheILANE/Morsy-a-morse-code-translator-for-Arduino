Morsy is a Morse code to alphabet encoder/decoder, created for the ocasion of a presentation of the Robotics department of Micro Club USTHB 2025 at "Formatech expo" 2025 in algiers . 
For this project you will need an Arduino Uno of any sort, a LCD module wired with a I2C protocol module (to make wireing easy), a pull-up button, a buzzer and an led (with it's 220 ohm resisor).
The project is pretty simple to make/remake for a beginner, it can also be used as a way to understand basic arduino functions while having them displayed at use in front of you !
